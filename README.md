# Implementation of the ACO ant algorithm in the traveling salesman problem

## Project goal
The aim of the project is to write a web application that uses the ant algorithm to 
solve the zero traveling salesman problem (TSP). The application is to find an optimal 
route that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the starting city, minimizing 
the total distance covered in the trip.
